# File-Manager-Python

Simple file manager that performs functions such as creating, deleting, updating, and modifying data in files in Python.

File Creation and Updating:
Develop functions or modules that can create new files based on predefined templates or update existing files with new data.
Implement error handling mechanisms to ensure the program handles exceptions and errors gracefully.
Incorporate appropriate file naming conventions and organization techniques to maintain a structured file system.

Data Modification:
Define methods or algorithms to modify data within the files based on the specified requirements.
Implement techniques such as parsing, searching, and replacing to identify and modify specific data elements.
Validate the modifications to ensure data integrity and consistency.

Batch Processing:
Enable the program to handle a large number of files efficiently by implementing batch processing techniques.
Develop mechanisms to iterate through directories, identify target files, and apply the necessary operations in a systematic manner.
Optimize the program's performance by minimizing resource usage and maximizing processing speed.
